    "\n",
    "[Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search) is a heuristic search algorithm for some kinds of decision processes, most notably those employed in game play. MCTS was introduced in 2006 for computer Go. It has been used in other board games like chess and shogi, games with incomplete information such as bridge and poker, as well as in real-time video games.\n",
    "\n",
    "MCTS consists of four steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Selection**: start from root R and select successive child nodes until a leaf node L is reached. The root is the current game state and a leaf is any node from which no simulation (playout) has yet been initiated. The section below says more about a way of biasing choice of child nodes that lets the game tree expand towards the most promising moves, which is the essence of Monte Carlo tree search.\n",
    "* **Expansion**: unless L ends the game decisively (e.g. win/loss/draw) for either player, create one (or more) child nodes and choose node C from one of them. Child nodes are any valid moves from the game position defined by L.\n",
    "* **Simulation**: complete one random playout from node C. This step is sometimes also called playout or rollout. A playout may be as simple as choosing uniform random moves until the game is decided (for example in chess, the game is won, lost, or drawn).\n",
    "* **Backpropagation**: use the result of the playout to update information in the nodes on the path from C to R.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Q-Value is the accumulated rewards from previous move selection\n",
    "* U-Value ii policy network reward\n",
